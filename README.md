**SnapTrack - Blockchain-Powered Wildlife Sightings**
**Overview**
SnapTrack is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to set bounties for images of wildlife sightings. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, security, and fair rewards for participants who contribute verified wildlife images.

**Features**
•	**Bounty Creation**: Users can create bounties for specific wildlife sightings by specifying location, species, and reward amount.

•	**Secure Transactions**: All bounty payments are handled via smart contracts, ensuring trust and fairness.

•	**Decentralized Verification**: Submitted images are verified by a decentralized network of validators before rewards are distributed.

•	**Tokenized Rewards**: Users are rewarded in cryptocurrency tokens, which can be used for further bounties or exchanged.

•	**Geo-Tagged Submissions**: Images must include metadata for verification of authenticity.

**How It Works**
1.	**Set a Bounty**: A user posts a bounty with details about the wildlife they want to see, including the required proof and reward amount.

2.	**Capture & Submit**: A participant uploads an image with geo-location and timestamp proof.

3.	**Verification Process**: Validators review submissions for authenticity and approve or reject them.

4.	**Reward Distribution**: Upon approval, the bounty is automatically paid out via smart contract.
